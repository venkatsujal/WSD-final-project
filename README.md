The project adheres to a common design pattern for building RESTful APIs with FastAPI. It organizes functionality into different modules:

1. main.py: Defines the FastAPI application and manages API endpoint routing. Pydantic models are used to specify request and response data structures for each endpoint.

2. crud.py: Contains CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functions for interacting with the SQLite database. It offers helper functions encapsulating database operations for customers, items, and orders.

3. db_init.py: Responsible for initializing the SQLite database and filling it with sample data from 'example_orders.json'. SQLAlchemy is used to define database models and relationships.

The project follows a relational database design with three main entities: 'Customer', 'Item', and 'Order', with specific relationships:

- A 'Customer' can have multiple 'Order' instances.
- An 'Order' can have multiple 'Item' instances (many-to-many relationship).
- An 'Order' is associated with a single 'Customer'.

The 'db_init.py' script sets up the database schema and enforces these relationships using foreign keys and an association table ('order_items') for the many-to-many relationship between 'Order' and 'Item'.

Implementation:

1. main.py: Imports necessary dependencies, defines Pydantic models for 'Customer', 'Item', and 'Order', sets up the database connection, and creates API endpoints using FastAPI's routing decorators.

2. crud.py: Defines CRUD functions for 'Customer', 'Item', and 'Order' using SQL queries executed against the SQLite database. It imports Pydantic models and database connection utilities and maps CRUD functions to corresponding API endpoints.

3. db_init.py: Defines SQLAlchemy models for 'Customer`, `Item', and 'Order', along with the association table 'order_items'. Functions like 'create_database' create the SQLite database file and 'load_data' populate it with sample data from 'example_orders.json'.

The project follows RESTful API best practices, leveraging HTTP verbs and appropriate status codes, using Pydantic for data validation, and SQLAlchemy for database interactions.

Usage:

1. Install Dependencies: 
   ```
   pip install fastapi pydantic uvicorn sqlalchemy
   ```

2. Initialize the Database: 
   ```
   python db_init.py
   ```

3. Start the Server: 
   ```
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```
4. Access the API: Visit http://localhost:8000/docs to interact with the API documentation and test the endpoints.
   
5. Perform CRUD Operations: Utilize endpoints like /customers, /items, and /orders with appropriate HTTP methods and payloads for CRUD operations.

6. Stop the Server: Press 'Ctrl+C' in the terminal where the server is running to stop it.

   

5. **Perform CRUD Operations**: Utilize endpoints like `/customers`, `/items`, and `/orders` with appropriate HTTP methods and payloads for CRUD operations.
